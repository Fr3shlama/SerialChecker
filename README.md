# SerialChecker

A simple Programm to detect wich Serialports are connected and wich are open

### What does it do?

This programm will search for all connected Serial devices and will try to open them. If they are in use (open) the name of the port will have a checked box on its left side.

I build this application for debug purposes to see if my APi is using certian ports

### Installing

Download the .exe and Run it.
